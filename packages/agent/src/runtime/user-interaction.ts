/**
 * FEATURE_222 — user-interaction primitive (agent layer).
 *
 * "Ask the user a question" is needed at BOTH layers: the coding `ask_user_*`
 * tools (LLM-initiated) AND the MCP elicitation reverse capability
 * (server-initiated). The capability historically lived only in
 * `@kodax-ai/coding`, but the MCP runtime lives one layer below in
 * `@kodax-ai/agent` and cannot reach up to it. So the primitive is owned here,
 * at the agent layer, and the host injects ONE implementation that both layers
 * share — coding re-exports these types for backward compatibility.
 *
 * The agent layer is UI-less by design: these are the contract the host
 * (REPL / ACP / SDK) fulfils with its real interaction surface. A headless host
 * leaves them undefined and consumers degrade gracefully (cancel / decline).
