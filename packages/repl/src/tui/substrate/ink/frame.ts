/**
 * Frame and Diff types for the cell-level renderer (FEATURE_057 Track F).
 *
 * `Frame` is what the React reconciler produces each render pass; the
 * renderer compares two frames and emits a `Diff` (an instruction list)
 * that the engine writes to the terminal stream.
 *
 * Architecturally aligned with `claudecode/src/ink/frame.ts`. Phase 1
 * intentionally omits CC-specific fields (`damage`, `scrollDrainPending`,
 * `FrameEvent.phases`) per the design doc out-of-scope list — those exist
 * to support optimizations Track F has explicitly deferred.

 *   the real terminal cursor at (`cursor`)
 *
 * Frames are immutable — they are observed by the renderer's diff loop and
 * never mutated in place.
 *
 * **Track F design-vs-impl note**: the v0.7.30 design doc lists
 * `Frame = { screen, cursor, viewport, scrollHint }` but also explicitly
 * marks DECSTBM hardware-scroll optimization (the `scrollHint` consumer)
 * as out-of-scope for Track F. KodaX's `Frame` therefore omits
 * `scrollHint` and `scrollDrainPending` (CC's `claudecode/src/ink/frame.ts`
 * fields). When the DECSTBM optimization is later scheduled, both fields
 * land here as `readonly scrollHint?: ScrollHint | null` and
 * `readonly scrollDrainPending?: boolean` — adding optional fields is a
