/**
 * FEATURE_125 (v0.7.41) — Team Mode Layer 3: tool-time soft warning.
 *
 * Detects overlap between this session's intended file mutation and
 * any sibling session's `activeFiles` set, then renders a short
 * banner the tool prepends to its `tool_result`. This layer NEVER
 * blocks — the LLM sees both the warning and the actual edit result
 * and self-decides whether to proceed, undo, or rework. The hard
 * block lives in Layer 4 (`content-hash-cache.ts`).
 *
 * Pure module: no fs, no clock, no globals. Sibling state comes from
 * Layer 2 (`discoverInstances` in `@kodax-ai/agent`); the caller
 * passes the snapshot in. Tests inject fixtures directly.
 *
 * Design point: matching is **exact-path equality**, NOT prefix /
 * directory containment. Per spec, `activeFiles` is the path the
 * sibling tool was invoked with; we compare verbatim. Path
 * normalization (case-folding on Windows, symlink resolution) is the
 * caller's responsibility — both sides should already be operating
 * on canonical paths.
