 * FEATURE_246 A5 (ADR-047): the host only launches workflows for an explicit

 * any mode (`'none'`) — in AMA/AMAW the Worker owns the decision through the
 * `run_workflow` tool, which scouts the codebase first and authors a script
 * from real findings (file paths, the actual sub-problems, a concrete
 * outputSchema). A blind host-side generator cannot investigate, so pre-empting
 * NL here produced shallow, disjointed workflows. SA has no workflow host.
 *
 * The decision is the source alone, so this takes no agent mode or input text:
 * the earlier NL detection (explicit/complexity/negation regexes) existed only
 * to gate the removed auto-start path — that judgment now belongs to the Worker
 * with full context, not a keyword match.
