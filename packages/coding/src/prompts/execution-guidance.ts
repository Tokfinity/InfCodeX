/**
 * Static EXECUTION GUIDANCE — the harness-LLM-judgment block the agent
 * self-applies INSTEAD of being told its execution mode / harness tier by the
 * keyword router (ADR-043). Shared verbatim by both the AMA Worker
 * (`buildWorkerInstructions`) and the top-level SA path (`capability-sections`)
 * so the two execution paths give the agent the same self-judgment guidance and
 * neither receives the old router `prompt-overlay`.
 *
 * The text is deliberately free of harness-tier / mode labels (ADR-033 §4): it
 * describes how to approach each kind of work as informal use-cases the LLM
 * matches against, not a classification table. Validated against the canonical
 * 5-alias panel for both the Worker (H3) and the SA path (P1.7).

Confirm the change does what the request wanted, backed by evidence (a test run, a re-read of the edited region) rather than confidence alone — because a change that looks right but was never verified is how silent regressions ship.',
  '- When you are reviewing code or a pull request: report only high-confidence issues that materially affect correctness, reliability, security, or merge-readiness. Do not list naming, formatting, or style preferences as findings — padding a review with nits buries the issues that matter. Lead with the must-fix items, then optional improvements, and for each issue state the concrete consequence it causes.',
  '- When you are doing a broad audit: cover correctness, security, performance, and maintainability together, and keep issues you have confirmed separate from lower-confidence risks so the reader can tell which is which.',
  '- When you are investigating a bug or an unknown: isolate the root cause and validate your assumptions with concrete evidence — a reproduction, a targeted check — before making broad changes, because a fix applied before the cause is understood usually treats a symptom.',
  '- When the task is design or planning work: reason through architecture, constraints, sequencing, and risks before writing code.',
  '- When the request is genuinely ambiguous: frame the options briefly and make the path you chose explicit before any irreversible edit, so the user can redirect before the cost is sunk.',
