/**
 * FEATURE_192 v0.7.44 — runner-driven goal lifecycle adapter.
 *
 * Encapsulates the wiring that turns a host-supplied `GoalRuntimeBinding`
 * (from `goal/runtime-wiring.ts`) into a pair of `beforeNextTurn` +
 * `stopHook` closures that the runner-driven outer loop can pass into
 * `Runner.run`. The factory composes three independent concerns at the
 * same lifecycle layer:
 *
 *   1. **FEATURE_164 base drain**: caller-supplied
 *      `baseBeforeNextTurn` performs the mid-turn user-prompt queue
 *      drain. Goal-agnostic; preserved verbatim.
 *
 *   2. **FEATURE_192 goal accounting + auto-continuation**: when a goal
 *      runtime binding is provided, `withGoalBeforeNextTurn` wraps the
 *      base drain with turn-end token-delta + wall-time accounting,
 *      and `withGoalStopHook` wraps the inner stop hook so a Worker
 *      text-only termination auto-reanimates with a continuation
 *      prompt when the goal is active. Both wraps are no-ops when
 *      `goalRuntime` is undefined (sync-dispatch / non-REPL test
 *      harness).
 *
 *   3. **FEATURE_123 per-turn flood counter reset**: the
 *      `sendMessageTurnCounter` lives on `baseCtx`; resetting it at
 *      every turn boundary belongs in the outermost `beforeNextTurn`
 *      composition (after the goal wrap fires its accounting but
 *      before the next turn observes a fresh counter).
 *
 * The factory also owns `turnStartMsRef` — the wall-clock anchor used
 * by `getTurnStartMs`. Hiding it inside the adapter scope ensures the
 * runner-driven caller cannot accidentally read a stale value mid-turn.
 *
 * Lift rationale: pre-extraction this composition lived inline at
 * `runner-driven.ts:1595-1677` (~80 LoC). Per CLAUDE.md "many small
 * files" principle and explicit user guidance to refactor when
 * runner-driven.ts inflates, this module owns the composition and
 * runner-driven keeps only a thin call site.
