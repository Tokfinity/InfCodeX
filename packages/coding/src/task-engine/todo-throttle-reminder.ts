/**
 * Todo Throttle Reminder — FEATURE_097 (v0.7.34) §5 ② + FEATURE_151 (v0.7.38).
 *
 * Layer 2 fallback for "model forgot to engage with the plan list": after
 * `TURNS_SINCE_TODO_UPDATE_REMINDER` consecutive Runner rounds without a
 * `todo_update` invocation, inject a `<system-reminder>` block. Mirrors
 * Claude Code's `getTodoReminderAttachments` (threshold tuned to KodaX's
 * heavier per-round cost — 8 vs Claude Code's 10).
 *
 * FEATURE_151 (v0.7.38) — the front gate `if (!todoStore.hasItems()) return false`
 * was a chicken-and-egg deadlock: when Scout did not seed (the common
 * case for tasks where `executionObligations.length < 2`), the store
 * stayed empty AND the reminder never fired AND the LLM had no signal
 * that a plan list was even available. With Slice B1 giving the LLM a
 * self-seeding path via `todo_update({op:'init', items:[...]})`, the
 * gate is removed and the reminder fires regardless of store state. The
 * text is now branched:
 *   - **empty store** → nudge the LLM toward `op:'init'` if the task is
 *     non-trivial (matches Claude Code's "TodoWrite hasn't been used
 *     recently" prompt that fires unconditionally).
 *   - **populated store** → unchanged from v0.7.34 — list the still-open
 *     items so the LLM knows what to act on.
 *
 * Counter scope:
 *   - **Per managed-task** lifetime: ONE `TodoReminderState` object per
 *     `runManagedTaskViaRunnerInner` call.
 *   - **Counter resets** on:
 *       1. any `todo_update` tool call (whether op:'init' or op:'update';
 *          the wrapper at `runner-driven.ts:buildRunnerAgentChain`
 *          clears it),
 *       2. role/agent transition.
 *   - **Increment** by 1 on every adapter call (each call = one round).
 *
 * Re-fire policy: RECURRING with a dedup gap (mirrors Claude Code's
 * `TURNS_BETWEEN_REMINDERS`, attachments.ts:254-257). After the first fire
 * at the threshold, stay quiet for `TURNS_BETWEEN_REMINDERS` rounds, then
 * fire again while the model keeps drifting. A model that ignores a single
 * nudge (e.g. kimi's documented narrate-without-tool floor) still gets
 * periodic pressure instead of permanent silence. The counter still resets
 * fully on any todo_update or role transition.
 *
 * FEATURE_104: this module produces LLM-facing prompt text and therefore
 * must have a paired eval at `tests/feature-097-throttle-reminder.eval.ts`.
