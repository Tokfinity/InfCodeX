/**
 * AMA-role tool exclude sets — exclude-based wiring contract.
 *
 * Each AMA role exposes "all registered tools minus its effective
 * exclude set". This module centralises the per-role exclude sets and
 * the two query helpers (`getAmaRoleEffectiveExclude`,
 * `getAmaRoleExpectedToolNames`) consumed by the agent-chain builder
 * (R3) and the FEATURE_168 contract tests.
 *
 * Extracted from `task-engine/runner-driven.ts` (lines 2095–2204 in
 * the pre-FEATURE_171 monolith) as part of FEATURE_171 (v0.7.41)
 * modular split. Zero behavior change — sets and helper bodies are
 * byte-identical to the previous in-file declarations.
 *
 * Why exclude-based: prior include-based wiring (each role's tools array
 * manually push'd) silently dropped 17 registered tools across multiple
 * features — FEATURE_120 collaboration controls, FEATURE_161 (4 of
 * 8 repo-intel pull tools the Worker prompt teaches), and the four web
 * tools (web_search / web_fetch / code_search / semantic_lookup). The
 * AMA path is shielded from SA-path defaults so wiring drift went
 * undetected by every test layer (handler unit tests pass, prompt
 * teaches the tool, registry registers it, CHILD_EXCLUDE excludes the
 * non-existent child copy — no test asserted "agent.tools actually
 * contains a schema with this name"). Defaulting to "all registered
 * tools available unless excluded" makes that drift architecturally
 * impossible: new tools land in every AMA role automatically, and
 * security-sensitive omissions become explicit (one new EXCLUDE entry
 * rather than five missing push lines).
