/**
 * FEATURE_192 v0.7.44 Phase B — Goal lifecycle hook composer.
 *
 * Wraps the existing `Runner.run` lifecycle hooks (`beforeNextTurn`,
 * `stopHook`) with goal-aware behaviour. Does NOT modify substrate —
 * the agent runtime exposes `beforeNextTurn` (FEATURE_164 v0.7.41) and
 * `stopHook` (FEATURE_184 v0.7.42) as already-stable hook surfaces;
 * this module is a thin composer the caller (REPL / driver) opts into.
 *
 * Wiring:
 *   - turn-end accounting → `beforeNextTurn` (fires after each tool
 *     execution, before the next LLM call)
 *   - agent_end continuation → `stopHook` (fires on text-only
 *     termination, can return a continuation prompt to reanimate)
 *
 * `enabled: false` returns pass-through wrappers — useful for hosts
 * that build the binding eagerly but want to no-op when no goal is
 * active. Goal feature ships default ON in v0.7.44; the `enabled`
 * knob is for embedders, not user-facing gating.
